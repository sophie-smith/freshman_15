This project was developed for HackCMU using Python and TensorFlow. Link to Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/freshman-15-112

Freshman 15 (112) takes a picture of food and identifies what it is. It then returns the amount of calories in a standard serving size of the food, and how many minutes of certain exercises it would take to burn the calories off. Included exercises are biking, running, swimming, and walking.

This was created using the machine learning open-source Tensor Flow library and the food-101 database. This model was trained using the 101 foods listed in this database with over 100,000+ images.
